# CloudHealth Metrics API

The CloudHealth Metrics API allows you to upload various performance metrics to CloudHealth. By doing so, you will not only have a better view into the health and performance of your systems, but CloudHealth will be able to generate better rightsizing recommendations.

Sending us metrics is as simple as POSTing a JSON document to the /metrics/v1 endpoint. The JSON format is described below.

__Note:__
 
1. Authentication via api-key is required as described in the main README document in this repo.

2. This API has a dry run facility that allows you to test your writes without actually persisting them to the database. To use it, just add `dryrun=true` as a query parameter to the URL.

3. If your client library does not support sending parameters via both the query string and the POST body, you can supply the API key and the dryrun flag as root level elements in the POST body.

4. We encourage you to include as many datapoints across multiple assets in a single request. For example, you could send 24 hourly metrics for 41 EC2 Instances in a single request. 

## Current Limitations
This early release has the following limitations:

- You can post CPU, memory, and file system metrics only
- Metrics must be at an hourly resolution
- An active AWS instance associated with the metrics must already be present and active in the CloudHealth platform and not be Chef-managed
- Metric retrieval is for individual assets only, that is, for AWS EC2 Instances or file systems of AWS EC2 Instances
- The payload can contain a max of 1000 data points. If there are more, the entire request is rejected with a 422 response.

When posting to file systems, the associated instance must be present and active as noted above. However, if a file system object does not currently exist, a new one is automatically created and linked to the instance. 

## Rate Limiting

- Rate limiting is at the "user" (i.e. API key) level.
- We allow a total of 60 POST's per minute.
- Read requests are currently not throttled.
- An HTTP status code of 429 is returned if the request is throttled.
- The client should be written to handle this response and retry with an exponential backoff.
- Since a payload can contain up to 1000 data points, a single client can push 60,000 data points per minute.

## POST Data Format
To send metrics to CloudHealth you need to provide a **collection of datasets**. Each dataset describes a single asset type: instance or file system currently. Each dataset consists of:

   - a **metadata header** describing the data being sent and 
   - an **array of values** that is the actual metrics data 

A collection of one or more datasets is bound up in a hash rooted with the **metrics** element.

```
"metrics": {
  "datasets": []
}
```

Each **dataset** is a hash consisting of metadata and an array of values. Each element in the **values array** is itself an array of metrics for a given interval and asset:

```
{
  "metadata": {},
  "values": [
    [],
  ]
}
```

The **metadata hash** describes the data you are sending. It consists of:

 - an asset type 
 - the granularity of the included data
 - an array of keys that describes the 'type' of each element in the values array

```
"metadata": {
  "assetType": 'aws:ec2:instance',
  "granularity": 'hour',
  "keys" [
    "assetId",
    "timestamp",
    "memory:free:bytes.avg",
    "memory:free:bytes.max",
    ...
  ]
}
```
##### The **supported asset types** are as follows:

- aws:ec2:instance
- aws:ec2:instance:fs

##### The following **granularities** are allowed:

- hour

##### The following **keys** are supported:

###### For **all** asset types:

 - assetId
 - timestamp

###### For **aws:ec2:instance** assets:

- `cpu:used:percent.avg`
- `cpu:used:percent.max`
- `cpu:used:percent.min`
- `memory:free:bytes.avg`
- `memory:free:bytes.min`
- `memory:free:bytes.max`
- `memory:size:bytes.avg`
- `memory:size:bytes.min`
- `memory:size:bytes.max`
- `memory:used:percent.avg`
- `memory:used:percent.min`
- `memory:used:percent.max`

###### For **aws:ec2:instance:fs** assets:

- `fs:size:bytes.avg`
- `fs:size:bytes.min`
- `fs:size:bytes.max`
- `fs:used:bytes.avg`
- `fs:used:bytes.min`
- `fs:used:bytes.max`
- `fs:used:percent.avg`
- `fs:used:percent.min`
- `fs:used:percent.max`


The **`values`** array has an entry for each series of metrics you care to send us. Each entry is itself an array of metrics corresponding to the elements in the **`keys`** array, that is, in the same order and of the same length.

**Each array of metrics:**

 - specifies the instance (using a compact form of the AWS ARN format) 
 - a timestamp (in ISO-8601 format) 
 - the supplied metrics (numbers: integer or float) 
 
Also note:

 - A single array of metrics can contain information about CPU and/or memory if the asset type is an instance 
 - Each instance or timestamp is a new array of values

The **compact ARN**: 

- for an **instance** must be in the form `<region>:<account-number>:<AWS-instance-ID>`  
- for a **file system**, the form is `<region>:<account-number>:<AWS-instance-ID>:<file-system-mount-point>` 
- And the **timestamp** must be on an hourly boundary and be UTC-based 

For example, for instance:

```
"values": [
  [ "us-east-1:12345678:i-a99a99a9", "2015-06-03T00:01:00+00:00", 200, 400, ...],
  [ "us-east-1:12345678:i-a99a99a9", "2015-06-03T00:02:00+00:00", 100, 300, ...],
]
```

or, for file system:

```
"values": [
  [ "us-east-1:12345678:i-a99a99a9:/opt", "2015-06-03T00:01:00+00:00", 200, 400, ...],
  [ "us-east-1:12345678:i-a99a99a9:/opt", "2015-06-03T00:02:00+00:00", 100, 300, ...],
]
```

Pulling this all together we have:

```
{
  "metrics": {
    "datasets": [
      {
        "metadata": {
          "assetType": "aws:ec2:instance",
          "granularity": "hour",
          "keys": [
            "assetId",
            "timestamp",
            "memory:free:bytes.avg",
            "memory:free:bytes.max",
            "memory:free:bytes.min"
            "memory:size:bytes.avg",
            "memory:size:bytes.max",
            "memory:size:bytes.min"
            "memory:used:percent.avg",
            "memory:used:percent.max",
            "memory:used:percent.min"
          ]
        },
        "values": [
          [
            "us-east-1:12345678:i-99999999",
            "2015-06-03T01:00:00+00:00",
            53687391300,
            107374182400,
            26843545600,
            322122547200,
            322122547200,
            322122547200,
            16.67,
            33.33,
            8.33
          ],
          [
            "us-east-1:12345678:i-88888888",
            "2015-06-03T02:00:00+00:00",
            53687391300,
            107374182400,
            26843545600,
            322122547200,
            322122547200,
            322122547200,
            16.67,
            33.33,
            8.33
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

And translating that to a curl command, we have:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/metrics/v1?api_key=<API-KEY>" -d '{"metrics":{"datasets":[{"metadata":{"assetType":"aws:ec2:instance","granularity":"hour","keys":["assetId","timestamp","memory:usedPercent.avg","memory:usedPercent.max","memory:usedPercent.min"]},"values":[["us-east-1:12345678:i-99999999","2015-06-03T01:00:00+00:00",100.0,200.0,50.0],["us-east-1:12345678:i-88888888","2015-06-03T02:00:00+00:00",25.5,45.2,15.0]]}]}}'
```


## POST Response Format
### Success and Partial Failure
If all or some of the posted metrics were accepted by the system, you will receive an HTTP 200 OK response code as well as a JSON message formatted as follows. Note that this API supports partial failure. And if there's partial failure, a 200 response is still returned.

#### Response Format

This is the response format for the API

```
"succeeded": <The total number of rows that were successfully processed.>,
"failed": <The total number of rows that were rejected.>,
"errors": [
  "<A textual description of all errors that prevented the entire payload or an entire dataset from being processed.>"
]

# Datasets provide details of failures at the row level within each dataset.
"datasets": [
  {
    "succeeded": <Count of all rows in this dataset that were successfully added to the system.>,
    "errors": [
        "<Textual representation of any errors that prevented all data in this dataset from being processed.>"
    ],
    "failures": [
      {
        "error": "<Textual representation of any parsing errors that prevented a single row of data from being accepted.>"
        "row:" <The original row data that was passed in>
      }
    ]
  }
```

Here is an example of the response:

```
{
  succeeded: 198,
  failed:    2,
  errors:    0,
  datasets:  [
    {
      "succeeeded": 100,
      "errors": [],
      "failures": []
    },
    {
      "succeeeded": 98,
      "errors": [],
      "failures": [
        {
          "error": "Number of values (6) must equal number of keys (5).",
          "row": [
              "us-east-1:12345678:i-99999999",
              "2015-06-03T02:00:00+00:00",
              100,
              75,
              50,
              111
          ]
        },
        {
          "error": "Percentage value (101) is greater than 100.",
          "row": [
              "us-east-1:12345678:i-88888888",
              "2015-06-03T03:00:00+00:00",
              101,
              75
              50
          ]
        },
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```

### Failure
A failure response (either 400 or 500) will be returned if no data could be processed. For instance, if the JSON document was malformed. In general, if you get a 4XX response, the problem exists in the payload, and you should be able to rectify it. A 429 means the request was throttled. A 500 response means there was some system failure on the CloudHealth side, and you should not try to resend the data immediately. In both cases, the response body is as follows:

```
{ "error": "<error message>" }
```

For example:

```
{ "error": "Invalid credentials" }
```

## Read API

Currently, you are limited to retrieving metric data for individual assets.  In the future, you'll be able to retrieve multiple assets and additional aggregate values.

To retrieve metrics for an asset, simply add an `asset` parameter to the query string and set it equal to the asset's AWS ARN.  For example:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/metrics/v1?api_key=<YOUR-API-KEY>&asset=arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:12345678:instance/i-99999999"
```

This will return the first 100 metrics for this instance ordered by the time they were created or last updated.  (Fewer than 100 metrics may be returned depending upon the selected granularity and time_range, and the available metrics.  For example using the default time_range=yesterday with an hourly granularity, 24 hourly sets of metrics will be returned).   The response format is very much the same as the POST format, with two notable exceptions.  One, the response is not wrapped in the `metrics` object, and two, there's a root-level `request` object, that contains a `next` link that can be followed to retrieve the next 100 metrics.  The `next` attribute will be `null` if there are no more records to retrieve.

```
{
   "request" : {
      "next" : "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/metrics/v1?api_key=<YOUR-API-KEY>&asset=arn%3Aaws%3Aec2%3Aus-east-1%3A12345678%3Ainstance%2Fi-99999999",
   },
   "datasets": [
      "metadata" : {
         "assetType" : "aws:ec2:instance",
         "granularity" : "hour",
         "keys" : [
            "assetId"
            "timestamp",
            "cpu:used:percent.avg",
            "cpu:used:percent.max",
            "cpu:used:percent.min",
            "memory:free:bytes.avg",
            "memory:free:bytes.max",
            "memory:free:bytes.min",
            "memory:used:percent.avg",
            "memory:used:percent.max",
            "memory:used:percent.min",
         ]
      },
      "values" : [
         [ "us-east-1:12345678:i-99999999", "2015-06-08T05:00:00Z", 76, 99, 51, null, null, null, 22.5, 52.2, 18.1 ],
         [ "us-east-1:12345678:i-99999999", "2015-06-08T06:00:00Z", 91, 99, 81, null, null, null, 25.2, 53, 19.7 ]
      ]
   ]
}
```

For a file system, the ARN looks like this: 'arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:12345678:instance/i-99999999:fs//opt'.

### Pagination
As noted, the default number of records returned is 100.  You can change this to any value between 1 and 500 by adding the `per_page` paramater to the query string.

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/metrics/v1?api_key=<YOUR-API-KEY>&asset=arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:12345678:instance/i-99999999&per_page=50"
```

You can also specify which page you want to start at with the `page` parameter.

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/metrics/v1?api_key=<YOUR-API-KEY>&asset=arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:12345678:instance/i-99999999&per_page=50&page=3"
```

If there are no values to display, the `values` array will be empty. If the `next` attribute is `null`, there are no pages beyond the current.

### Time Range
You can limit what time range to retrieve asset information for.  The default is _yesterday_, but you can specify a custom time range with the `time_range` query parameter. `time_range` takes well know strings as arguments. They are enumerated here.and mostly self-explanatory, but for the record, "mtd" = "month to date" and "wtd" = "week to date".

- mtd
- last_month
- last\_3_months
- last\_6_months
- last\_12_months
- wtd
- last\_week
- last\_2_weeks
- last\_4_weeks
- last\_52_weeks
- today
- yesterday
- last\_2_days
- last\_7_days
- last\_14_days
- last\_31_days

Thus, you can get the month-to-date metrics with this curl command:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/metrics/v1?api_key=<YOUR-API-KEY>&asset=arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:12345678:instance/i-99999999&time_range=mtd"
```

### Granularity
The Metrics API currently accepts metrics at an hourly resolution.  However, you can ask for those base metrics to be rolled up to various other resolutions via the `granularity` parameter.  If you don't ask, the default is `hour`.  The addional granularities are:

- day
- week
- month

For example, to request daily rollups of last month's metrics for an instance:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/metrics/v1?api_key=<YOUR-API-KEY>&asset=arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:12345678:instance/i-99999999&time_range=last_month&granularity=day"
```

Note, you want to be sure that `time_range` is large enough to encompass the requested granularity; asking for yesterday's data at a monthly resolution will return no rows -- not an error.  And requesting yesterday's data with a granularity of `day` will return one row.

Further note, that rollups are calculated daily. You will not receive _today's_ data at any granularity other than hourly (the default).
