  Familiarize yourself with the format of the XML specification that you can post to define the custom price book for a customer.

  **XML Formatting:**
  XML is a file format that allows you to enter markup language that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Custom price book specifications are written in XML. To write your specifications, you need an XML editor. If you donâ€™t already have an XML editor, CloudHealth recommends [XML Spear](http://www.donkeydevelopment.com/).

  **Rule Order:**
  Custom price book XML specifications process rules in top-down order. The first applicable rule that satisfies all specified constraints for a line item is used, and then no subsequent rules are used for that line item. If no applicable and matching rule is found, the line item will have a 0% calculated price adjustment.

  **Rule Applicability:**
  Rule applicability is determined by the startDate and endDate attributes in enabled RuleGroup elements. startDates and endDates are inclusive. Whether or not an applicable rule is actually used depends on its order relative to other rules and the constraints it specifies for matching line items.

  **Example:**

  ```
  <CHBillingRules createdBy=\"user@partner.com\" date=\"2018-01-01\">
    <Comment>This is the Price Book specification for a Customer</Comment>

    <RuleGroup>

      <BillingRule name=\"10% on EC2\" includeDataTransfer=\"true\">
      <BasicBillingRule billingAdjustment=\"10.0\" billingRuleType=\"percentDiscount\"/>
        <Product productName=\"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\"/>
      </BillingRule>

      <BillingRule name\"$0.50 flat rate for CloudFront\">
      <BasicBillingRule billingAdjustment=\"0.5\" billingRuleType=\"fixedRate\"/>
        <Product productName=\"Amazon CloudFront\"/>
      </BillingRule>

      <BillingRule name=\"10% markup on RDS charges in us-east-1\">
      <BasicBillingRule billingAdjustment=\"10.0\" billingRuleType=\"percentIncrease\">
        <Product productName=\"Amazon Relational Database System\">
          <Region name=\"us-east-1\"/>
        </Product>
      </BillingRule>

    </RuleGroup>

  </CHBillingRules>
  ```
