  > CloudHealth provides two APIs for programmatically interacting with the platform: a REST API and a GraphQL API. You are currently viewing the documentation for the REST API. To access the documentation for the GraphQL API, [click here](https://help.cloudhealthtech.com/graphql-api/).

  Welcome to the CloudHealth REST API Guide. Here you'll find API services that programmatically retrieve data from the CloudHealth Platform.

  The CloudHealth REST API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and it uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. All API responses, including errors, return JSON.

  This API continues to be under development and will evolve. CloudHealth sends information on additions and changes to the API in the Product Updates emails that go out to all customers.
