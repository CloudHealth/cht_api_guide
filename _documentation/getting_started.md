  Welcome to the CloudHealth API Hub. Here you'll find API services that programmatically retrieve data from the CloudHealth Platform.

  The CloudHealth API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer){:target="_blank"}. The API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and it uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. All API responses, including errors, return JSON.

  This API continues to be under development and will evolve. CloudHealth sends information on additions and changes to the API in the Product Updates emails that go out to all customers.
