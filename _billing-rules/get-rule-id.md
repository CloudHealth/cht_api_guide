title: How to Get Billing Rule ID
position: 2
content_markdown: |-
  In order to use some Billing Rule endpoints, you need to provide the `partner_billing_rule_id`. CloudHealth generates a unique ID for each billing rule. You can get the Billing Rule ID for an organization from the CloudHealth Platform. From the left menu, go to **Partner > Partner Billing > Billing Rules** and view or edit the organization. The Organization ID appears in the browser URL. Here's an example URL:

  ```
  https://apps.cloudhealthtech.com/partner_billing_rules/57XXXXXXXXX96/edit
  ```

  Here, `57XXXXXXXXX96` is the Billing Rule ID.

  The Billing Rule ID can also be retrieved using the [Create Billing Rule](#billing-rules_create-new-partner-billing-rule) and [Get All Billing Rules](#billing-rules_get-all-billing-rules) endpoints.
