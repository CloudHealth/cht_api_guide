title: How to Get Azure Enterprise Agreement ID
position: 3
content_markdown: |-
  In order to use some Billing Rule endpoints, you may need to provide the Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) ID. CloudHealth generates a unique ID for each EA. You can get the Azure EA ID from the CloudHealth Platform. From the left menu, go to **Setup > Accounts > Azure Enrollment** and view or edit the EA. The Azure EA ID appears in the browser URL. Here's an example URL:

  ```
  https://apps.cloudhealthtech.com/azure_enrollments/20XXXXXXX19/edit
  ```

  Here, `20XXXXXXX19` is the Azure EA ID.
