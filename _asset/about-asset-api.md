  The Assets API allows you to retrieve information on AWS, Azure, Data Center, and Google Cloud assets in your environment. The API supports the following operations:
  * Retrieve the API names of all AWS, Azure, Data Center, and Google Cloud asset objects that you can query in the CloudHealth Platform.
  * Retrieve the attributes of an asset, including the Perspective Groups to which the asset belongs, as well as assets related to the queried asset.
  * Query objects of a specific type, filter objects by attribute, and list specific fields of assets in the response.
