title: How to Get Organization ID
position: 2
content_markdown: |-
  In order to use some Organization endpoints, you need to provide the `org_id`. CloudHealth generates a unique ID for each organization. You can get the Organization ID for an organization from the CloudHealth Platform. From the left menu, go to **Setup > Admin > Organizations** and view or edit the organization. The Organization ID appears in the browser URL. Here's an example URL:

  ```
  https://apps.cloudhealthtech.com/organizations/20XXXXXXXX09
  ```

  Here, `20XXXXXXXX09` is the Organization ID.

  The Organization ID can also be retrieved using the [Get All Organizations](#organization_get-all-organizations) endpoint.
