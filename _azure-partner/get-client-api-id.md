title: How to Get Client API ID
position: 2
content_markdown: |-
  In order to use the Partner API, you need to include an additional parameter, the `client_api_id`, with each request. CloudHealth generates a unique ID for each partner customer.

  You can get the Client API ID for a customer using the [Get All Customers](#azure-partner_get-all-partner-customers) endpoint. You can get the Client API ID for a customer from the CloudHealth Platform. From the left menu, select **Partner > Customer > List**. If the **Client API Id** column is not visible in the report, add it by clicking the **Edit Columns** button.
