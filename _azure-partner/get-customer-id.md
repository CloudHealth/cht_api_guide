title: How to Get Database Partner Customer ID
position: 2
content_markdown: |-
  In order to use some of the Azure Partner endpoints, you need to provide the `db_partner_customer_id`. CloudHealth generates a unique ID for each partner customer.

  You can get the Database Partner Customer ID for a partner customer from the CloudHealth Platform. From the left menu, go to **Setup > Accounts > Azure Partner Customers** and open the partner customer. The database ID of the partner customer appears in the browser URL. Here's an example URL:
  ```
  https://apps.cloudhealthtech.com/azure_partner_customers/5XXXXXXXXXX25
  ```

  Here, `5XXXXXXXXXX25` is the Database Partner Customer ID.

  The Database Customer ID can also be retrieved using the [Get Single Partner Customer](/azure-partner/get-single-customers-list.html) endpoint.
