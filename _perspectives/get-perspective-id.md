position: 3
content_markdown: |-
  In order to perform Get, Put, and Post operations using this API, you need to provide the ID of the Perspective that you want to manipulate.

  You can get the ID of a Perspective from the CloudHealth Platform. From the left menu, select **Setup > Perspectives** and click the Perspective that you want to manipulate. The ID of the Perspective appears in the browser URL. Here's an example URL:
  ```
  https://apps.cloudhealthtech.com/perspectives/35261XXX012
  ```

  Here, `35261XXX012` is the Perspective ID.
