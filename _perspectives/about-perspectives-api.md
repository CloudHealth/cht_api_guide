  The Perspectives API allows you to manipulate a schema file that defines the rules for grouping assets in a Perspective. Use the following endpoint:
  ```
  https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/v1/perspective_schemas
  ```
  Using a schema file as a payload, you can perform these operations:
  * Create Perspectives
  * Modify rules that govern how Perspective Groups are created
  * Merge Groups
  * Reorder Groups
  * Delete Perspectives
